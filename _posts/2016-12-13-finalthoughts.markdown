Prior to enter CPSC350 Application of Databases I dabbled with some HTML and SQL. I knew the basics of creating a html page and how to work
and manipulate data using SQl. Learning the basics of HTML and SQL definently benefited me when I was first getting confortable creating a site
using Flask. Although I did not understand how to work with CSS, I do not believe it inhibited me from doing well in the course. To anyone 
planning on taking CSPC350 at UMW I would recommend looking into HTML and SQL prior to the beginning of the course. Make sure you know how to 
use insert, select, and joins statements.

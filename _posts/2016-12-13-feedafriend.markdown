I partnered up with Nate Nuval and Michael Prime to bring you Feed a Friend. The idea originating from the abundance or lack of mealswipes
at the end of each semester. We wanted to offer a solution to the issue at hand. We wante to present students with the opportunity to help 
their fellow classmate in need.

On our site, we allowed for two different types of users, Givers and Receivers. Givers are students with an abundance of mealswipes while 
Receivers are students in need of mealswipes.

Current limitations:
We only allow for UMW students to signup for Feed-a-Friend. Availability must be reset daily. Lack of a messaging system to communicate 
between a giver and receiver who "matched". Users cannot change their profile images.

Future progress:
Although it is unlikely that this project will be continued, we can only hope in the future the project would be expanded to allow for users 
from various schools to participate. Another possibility would be paring up with the schools to gain access to the mealswipe database 
allowing Feed-a-Friend to keep track of each givers remaining swipes. A necessary addition to the site would be to reset the availability of all givers
on a daily basis, they would then be asked to update their availability the first time they login for the day. Lastly a messaging system must be 
added for users convienience, users should not have to exit the application to be able to communicate with other users.

I partnered up with Nate Nuval and Michael Prime to bring you Feed a Friend. An idea originating by the abundance or lack of mealswipes
at the end of each semester. We wanted to propose a solution to the issue at hand in which students can help their fellow classmate in need.

On our site, we allowed for two different types of users, Givers and Receivers. Givers are students with an abundance of mealswipes while 
Receivers are students in need of mealswipes.

How to use Feed-A-Friend:
1) Login
![Login Page](https://chelseairizarry.github.io/assets/article_images/feedafriend/frontpage.JPG)

Proceed as followed depending on your user type.

Giver:

2) Proceed to update availability, if needed.
3) Respond to any pending requests in email.

Receiver:

2) Proceed to search by user or meal type.
3) Request desired meal time and user.
4) Contact user for location and confirmation.

If the given user wanted to check their profile information all they would have to do would be to click their profile image and a expandable
textbox would appear containing their information.

To update the profile information, the user would then click edit profile. From here, the
user can edit any or all fields, including the user type.

Current limitations:
We only allow for UMW students to signup for Feed-a-Friend. Availability must be reset daily. Lack of a messaging system to communicate 
between a giver and receiver who "matched". Users cannot change their profile images.

Future progress:
Although it is unlikely that this project will be continued, we can only hope in the future we could expand and allow for users from various
schools to participate. Another possibility would be paring up with the schools themselves to gain access to the mealswipe database to allow
Feed-a-Friend to keep track of each givers remaining swipes. A necessary addition to the site would be to reset the availability of all givers
on a daily basis so that givers do not have to remember to update their availability, instead they would be asked the first time they login 
for the day. Lastly a messaging system must be added for users convienience, users should not have to exit the application to be able to 
communicate with other users.

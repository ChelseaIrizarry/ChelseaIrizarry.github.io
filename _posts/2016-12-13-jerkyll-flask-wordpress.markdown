I have had a lot of experience using WordPress over the past four years at the University of Mary Washington. I have found that WordPress is
a powerful tool when coming to creating websites. WordPress allows for quick and easy theme, menu, or photo swaps while Jerkyll does not.
A benefit with using WordPress is that you do not need to know anything about html or css to be able to manipulate the content of your site.
The simplicity of this tool also comes with limitations, although, you can manipulate some portions of the site using html or css there will 
always be parts of the site in which you cannot edit due to theme defaults.

The following shows the front-end and the back-end of my personal WordPress powered site.

It is clear that the back-end or dashboard is more user friendly for those non-programmers wanting to own a site. A visible issue with this setup
is that you cannot see any code making it difficult or impossible to attach addition databases to the site.

Below is the back-end of this Jerkyll powered site. As you can see it is not as appealing to the eye as a WordPress site would be.

Lastly, the following is the back-end of a Flaskified site called Where In The World in which you can search different cities and countries
within the database.
